## Day 02: WHERE, AND, OR, NOT, IN, BETWEEN

### 🔍 Concepts Covered:
- `WHERE` clause to filter rows based on conditions
- Combining conditions with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`
- Filtering with `IN` and `BETWEEN`

### 🧠 Learning Notes:
- `WHERE` is used to filter rows before aggregation.
- `AND` returns true if **all** conditions are true.
- `OR` returns true if **any** condition is true.
- `NOT` negates a condition.
- `IN` helps check if a column’s value matches **any value** in a list.
- `BETWEEN` selects values **within a range** (inclusive).
