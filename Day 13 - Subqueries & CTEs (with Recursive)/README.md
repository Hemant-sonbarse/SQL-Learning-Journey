# ðŸ“… Day 13 - Subqueries & Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

## âœ… Concepts Covered

- **Subqueries**
  - In `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE` clauses
  - Scalar vs correlated subqueries
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**
  - Reusable temporary result sets
  - Simplify complex joins/aggregations
- **Recursive CTEs**
  - Use for hierarchical or iterative logic

## ðŸ§  Learning Notes

- Subqueries return intermediate results used in outer queries.
- CTEs make your query modular and readable.
- Recursive CTEs are powerful but should have an exit condition.
