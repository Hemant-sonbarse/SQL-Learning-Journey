# Day 06 - GROUP BY with Aggregates (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN)

## âœ… Concepts Covered
- `GROUP BY` groups rows by specified column(s).
- Aggregate functions: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`.

## ðŸ§  Learning Notes
- Use `GROUP BY` to apply aggregate functions per group (e.g., per department).
- Always include non-aggregated columns in `GROUP BY`.
- NULLs are ignored in aggregates like `SUM()` and `AVG()`.

## ðŸ“Œ Practice Table
See `Employees.sql` for records across departments.
